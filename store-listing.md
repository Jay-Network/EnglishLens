EigoLens turns your camera into a powerful English reading assistant. Capture any text, tap a word, and get instant definitions - all offline, all on-device.

CORE FEATURES

Tap Any Word for Instant Definitions
Capture text with your camera, then simply tap any word to look it up. No menus, no typing - just tap. EigoLens includes a comprehensive offline dictionary with over 147,000 words and 207,000 definitions powered by WordNet. Works without internet.

Circle Phrases for Multi-Word Lookup
Need to look up a phrase? Switch to circle mode and draw around multiple words. EigoLens will look up the phrase or fall back to individual word definitions. After selection, you're automatically back in tap mode.

Full-Screen Image with Overlay Panel
Your captured text stays full-screen while the definition panel slides up from the bottom. Drag the panel to resize it. Pinch to zoom and pan the image with two fingers - even while in tap mode.

Smart Word Analysis
Every word lookup includes:
- Multiple definitions organized by part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.)
- Synonyms and antonyms
- Word frequency indicators (Top 100, Common, Moderate, Rare)
- Automatic lemmatization - inflected words like "running", "went", or "mice" resolve to their base forms

Reading Level Analysis
Understand how difficult a text is with four standard readability formulas:
- Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
- Flesch Reading Ease Score
- SMOG Index
- Coleman-Liau Index

Each text gets a difficulty rating from Very Easy to Very Difficult, with the equivalent U.S. grade level and target audience.

Natural Language Processing
EigoLens includes a built-in NLP pipeline that identifies:
- Parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and more)
- Named entities (dates, numbers, proper nouns)
- Root word forms through lemmatization
