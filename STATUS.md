## Architecture Decisions (Cross-Platform)

| Decision | Android | iPad |
|----------|---------|------|
| OCR engine | ML Kit Text Recognition | Apple Vision (VNRecognizeTextRequest) |
| Dictionary | Bundled WordNet SQLite | Bundled WordNet SQLite (same DB) |

## Shared Assets

- WordNet SQLite database (can share the same .db file)
- AI prompt templates (same prompts, different language wrappers)
- Readability formulas (same math: Flesch-Kincaid, SMOG, Coleman-Liau)
- App icon / branding (shared design, platform-specific assets)

## Update Protocol

1. When you complete a feature, update the parity matrix above
2. When starting new work, update the "Current Sprint" section
3. If you make an architecture decision that affects the other platform, note it in "Architecture Decisions"
4. Prefix your commit with the platform: `[Android]` or `[iPad]`
